<center><p>The history of Manipur is reflected by archaeological research, mythology and written history. Historically, Manipur was an independent sovereign kingdom ruled by Meitei dynasty but at different point of time it was invaded and rule over by other state and authority.[1][2][3][4] The Kangleipak State developed under King Loiyumba with its first written constitution in the early 12th century.[5] Manipur under the 18th-century king Pamheiba saw the legendary burning of sacred scripture.</p>

	<i>Manipur became a princely state under British rule in 1891 after the Anglo-Manipur war, the last of the independent states to be incorporated into British Raj as a princely state.[6] During the Second World War, Manipur was the scene of battles between Japanese and Allied forces. After the war, Maharaja Bodhachandra signed a Treaty of Accession merging the kingdom into India.[7] It was made a union territory in 1956[8] and a full-fledged state in 21 January 1972</i>

	<center><h1>Moirang</h1></center>
	<center><p>Moirang, located in the Bishnupur district of Manipur, holds great historical and cultural significance. It became prominent during the Indian freedom struggle when the Indian National Army (INA) hoisted the Indian tricolor for the first time on Indian soil on April 14, 1944, under the leadership of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

Moirang is also a hub of Manipuri culture and traditions. It is famous for the folk dance "Moirang Sai," and its folklore is enriched by the love story of Khamba and Thoibi. Additionally, it is close to the iconic Loktak Lake and Keibul Lamjao National Park, home to the endangered Sangai deer.
